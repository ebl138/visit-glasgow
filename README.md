# Visit Glasgow

Visit Glasgow is a website that aims to encourage prospective tourists to visit this city by showcasing it primarily through photos, informative facts and the best jokes Glasgow has to offer. This site provides information about Glasgow, its places of interest, its people and their humour in a fun and engaging way and its target audience is people with an interest in learning about this unique city. Visit Glasgow will be of most use to people who have never been, don't much much about it and want to learn just enough to entice them to visit.

## Features

- __Image based design__

  - As Visit Glasgow is a site to showcase a location, there are images across all four pages featuring its most iconic and recognisable parts, instead of an abundance of text.
  - These images in particular aid in helping prospective visitors learn about Glasgow visually and give ideas of locations to visit, accompanied with supporting text where necessary.
  - Along with other aspects of the site, images help create and maintain visual interest which engages users more.

- __Navigation__

  - Appearing on each of the four pages, the semi-transparent navigation bar displays across the top of the screen from left to right and is consistent on every page.
  - The navigation feature displays the site name, Visit Glasgow, on its left side in a clear yet styled way and, when clicked, will take the user to the Home page.
  - There are four links to the four pages of the website; Home, Gallery, Join the community! and Best Weegie Jokes; these links highlight in a light blue colour when hovered over to add visual appeal.
  - On mobile devices less than 768 pixels wide, the navigation bar contracts into a menu represented by a hamburger icon which, when clicked, expands down to display the four links.

- __Information blocks__

  - The information blocks provide the user with informative facts about Glasgow and its distinctive accent and the locals so they can learn about aspects of the city.
  - These blocks give an introduction to the city in a fun way which engages the user.

- __Map section__

  - The map at the bottom of the Home page will allow the user to see exactly where the locations featured in the Where to visit? section are and shows surrounding areas to help with orientation.
  - The map can be interacted with, opened in a new tab to display a larger version and shared on social media to help the user plan their trip.

- __Join the community! page (Sign up or Log in)__

  - This page will allow the user to Become a Weegie (sign up for an account) or log in to their account if they are a returning user. Giving the user the ability to log in will increase the chance of visiting Glasgow as they can come back to the site and see saved locations and images (implemented as part of a future feature).
  - When signing up for an account, a user will be asked to submit a desired username to create interest.

- __The Footer__

  - The footer section includes links to the social media pages for the Visit Glasgow community. The links will open to a new tab to minimise disruption for the user.
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it allows them to stay connected with other users of the site and keep them coming back

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Validator Testing

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
