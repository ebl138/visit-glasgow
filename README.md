# Visit Glasgow

Visit Glasgow is a website that aims to encourage prospective tourists to visit this city by showcasing it primarily through photos, informative facts and the best jokes Glasgow has to offer. This site provides information about Glasgow, its places of interest, its people and their humour in a fun and engaging way and its target audience is people with an interest in learning about this unique city. Visit Glasgow will be of most use to people who have never been, don't much much about it and want to learn just enough to entice them to visit.

## Features

- __Image based design__

  - As Visit Glasgow is a site to showcase a location, there are images across all four pages featuring its most iconic and recognisable parts, instead of an abundance of text.
  - These images in particular aid in helping prospective visitors learn about Glasgow visually and give ideas of locations to visit, accompanied with supporting text where necessary.
  - Along with other aspects of the site, images help create and maintain visual interest which engages users more.
  - Includes the hero sections of pages and the Where to Visit? section on the Home page

- __Navigation__

  - Appearing on each of the four pages, the semi-transparent navigation bar displays across the top of the screen from left to right and is consistent on every page.
  - The navigation feature displays the site name, Visit Glasgow, on its left side in a clear yet styled way and, when clicked, will take the user to the Home page.
  - There are four links to the four pages of the website; Home, Gallery, Join the community! and Best Weegie Jokes; these links highlight in a light blue colour when hovered over to add visual appeal.
  - On mobile devices less than 768 pixels wide, the navigation bar contracts into a menu represented by a hamburger icon which, when clicked, expands down to display the four links.

- __Information blocks__

  - The information blocks provide the user with informative facts about Glasgow and its distinctive accent and the locals so they can learn about aspects of the city.
  - These blocks give an introduction to the city in a fun way which engages the user.

- __Map section__

  - The map at the bottom of the Home page will allow the user to see exactly where the locations featured in the Where to visit? section are and shows surrounding areas to help with orientation.
  - The map can be interacted with, opened in a new tab to display a larger version and shared on social media to help the user plan their trip.

  - The gallery features a slider function which allows the user to browse through 8 images in an interactive way.

- __Join the community! page (Sign up or Log in)__

  - This page will allow the user to Become a Weegie (sign up for an account) or log in to their account if they are a returning user. Giving the user the ability to log in will increase the chance of visiting Glasgow as they can come back to the site and see saved locations and images (implemented as part of a future feature).
  - When signing up for an account, a user will be asked to submit a desired username to create interest.

- __Best Weegie Jokes page__

  - This page will allow the user to learn about Glasgow locals' unique humour and they can learn some of the Glaswegian dialect.

- __The Footer__

  - The footer section includes links to the social media pages for the Visit Glasgow community. The links will open to a new tab to minimise disruption for the user.
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it allows them to stay connected with other users of the site via social media and keep them coming back.
  - Text also informs the user that the favicon was created using favicon.ico.

### Features Left to Implement

- A 'Reviews' page which would reference the four best and four worst reviews received by Glasgow businesses/places. This would give even more information to the user about Glasgow and suggest locations to visit or activities to do.
- A video addition to the Best Weegie jokes page of Billy Connolly's best joke. This would be valuable to the user to allow them to learn more about Glaswegian humour and, by extension, Glasgow.
